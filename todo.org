* Emacs
** Can I specify my hjkl as hnei (i.e. colemaks binding) in one place?
I can see `.left`, `.right`, `.up` and `.down` variable in evil code that look suspicious
This may fix hjkl, but all of the other colemak keys will need to be remapped too.

* Git
** Notes on rebase in a PR train
Say you have a PR train of branches: main <- A <- B <- C. A is branched off main and so on.

If you want to rebase on an updated main, you can checkout C and run `git rebase
green --update-refs`. This means you will only have to resolve a merge conflict
between the new main and A once, not for every branch after the merge conflict
as well.

If A is merged into main, you can rebase  B <- C onto main by checking out C and
then running `git rebase --onto main A C --update-refs`.
